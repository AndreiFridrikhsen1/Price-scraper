This program scrapes prices off eBay for specific items, calculates each item's average price, and writes the data to a Word document.
When a user starts the program, they need to choose the number of items they wish to search for, the number of days they wish to track the prices, and the name of the items. For input validation, I used pyinput plus where the number of days and items must be an integer. If the user enters the name of the item that doesnâ€™t the prices will be zero which will raise an exemption. The filterInput() function filters user input by concatenating all the entered words together, removing leading and trailing whitespaces, and then adding the string to the path. For matching prices, I used regex which searches for prices in $1,000.00 or $ 999.99 format since the program is designed to search for items such as game consoles, laptops, and expensive mobile phones. All the prices below $200 get removed from the arrays assuming this is a scam or delivery price. If the price is a 6-digit number it has a comma in it, so the code removes the comma for further operations such as converting to float and calculating the average. After calculating the average, the program will write the name of the item entered by the user to the Word document along with its average price and the date.
